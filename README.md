# General description:

The project features a greeting and six games based on school course of mathematics.

Each game is played in the command line and requires from the player to correctly answer fixed number of questions in a row.

Should the player fail, the game ends and can be replayed by typing the name of the game.

# Games description:

1. brain-games: greeting of the player

2. brain-calc: calculate the result of the equation

3. brain-even: determine if the number is even

4. brain-gcd: calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers

5. brain-prime: determine if the number is even

6. brain-progression: calculate the hidden number in the progression

# Installation:
