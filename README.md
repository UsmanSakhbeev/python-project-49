GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

The project features a greeting and six games based on school course of mathematics.

Each game is played in the command line and requires from the player to correctly answer fixed number of questions in a row.

Should the player fail, the game ends and can be replayed by typing the name of the game.

GAMES DESCRIPTION:

brain-games: greeting of the player

brain-calc: calculate the result of the equation

brain-even: determine if the number is even

brain-gcd: calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers

brain-prime: determine if the number is even

brain-progression: calculate the hidden number in the progression

Installation:

Clone the code to your directory: git clone https://github.com/UsmanSakhbeev/python-project-49.git 

Build the project with poetry: make build

Install required packages: make package-install
